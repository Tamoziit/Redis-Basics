**REDIS STREAMS
A Redis Stream is a data structure that acts like an append-only log (similar to Kafka), but also implements several operations to overcome some of the limits of a typical append-only log.
These includes random access in O(1) time and complex consumption startegies (consumer groups). --> Basically used to track faced paced operations of the application
eg: > Event sourcing (eg: tracking user options, clicks, etc.)
    > Sensor monitoring (eg: readings from devices in the field)
    > Notifications etc.

--> XADD <key> <value> : Adds a data to a Redis-stream. It returns a timestamp when the value to the key was added.
eg: 
127.0.0.1:6379> XADD temperatures:us-ny:10007 * temp_f 87.2       pressure 29.69 humidity 46
"1719487819250-0" //timestamp
--> This command creates a collection "temperatures" --> under which it has a STREAM for entry "us-ny" with id 10007 --> The Stream in turn has keys: temp_f, pressure, hummidity.

Other Commands., with similar func. as their asymptotes (corresponding cmds of other data types) --> XRANGE, XLEN, XREAD etc. [ref: documentation]
